# User-Notebooks
Notebooks for ePSIC users.

In addition to the example notebooks contained here we advise users to look at example notebooks in the following locations:

Hyperspy: https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos
Pyxem: https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem-demos
Py4DSTEM: https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM/tree/dev/py4DSTEM/notebooks

All ePSIC users can run these notebooks (and their own) on Diamond's Jupyterhub instance. Instructions for using Jupyterhub (logging in with your fedID) can be found at https://diamondlightsource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EPSICWEB/pages/167346199/Instructions+to+connect+to+Diamond+s+JupyterHub.
